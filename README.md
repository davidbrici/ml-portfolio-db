# David's Machine Learning Portfolio

Welcome to my **Machine Learning Portfolio**! 🚀 This repository is a curated collection of my work in **Machine Learning (ML), Computer Vision (CV), and Model Deployment**. It contains coding guides, project implementations, and pipelines designed for practical learning and real-world applications.

## 🔥 About This Portfolio
This repository is structured into different sections to showcase:
- **Coding Guides** 📚 → Fact sheets and easy-to-implement code snippets for Python, ML, CV, and deployment.
- **Machine Learning Projects** 🤖 → Various models, visualizations, and pipelines.
- **Computer Vision Projects** 👁️ → Object detection, image processing, and feature extraction.
- **Deployment Projects** 🚀 → End-to-end ML model deployment on cloud platforms.
